# Mailship

A solution for shipping emails as cheaper as possible.


## How it works

Some mail services provide you free mails per month. For example, Mailgun
has 10k free mails, Mandrill has 12k free mails, that's 22k free mails per
month totally.

However, when you grow bigger, you would like to buy a dedicated IP for
your email service, in this case, you'd better stick to one service. But
you can still take advantage of the free mails for trigger emails.
